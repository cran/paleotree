#' Simulating Un-Conditioned Trees of Fossil Taxa
#' 
#' Creates sets of paleo-trees with minimal conditioning and with sampling such
#' that lineages may be missing and terminal branches are truncated, but
#' node-times are known perfectly
#' 
#' @details
#' This function is essentially a complex wrapper for simFossilTaxa, sampleRanges 
#' and taxa2phylo, and users should refer to the respective documentation for those
#' functions in addition to this manual page: \code{\link{simFossilTaxa}}, 
#' \code{\link{taxa2phylo}} and \code{\link{sampleRanges}}.
#'
#' This function will output simulated phylogenies of fossil taxa
#' where the divergence times are perfectly known, only sampled taxa are
#' included on the tree and tips are located at the last observed time for the
#' species (the apparent time of extinction, except for living taxa).
#' 
#' simPaleoTrees essentially uses simFossilTaxa with no.cond as TRUE and other
#' minimal conditioning, so as to get as unbiased a sample of simulations as
#' possible (without exceeding the maximum constraints). This is useful for
#' birth-death analyses, although a number of options available in
#' simFossilTaxa are thus unavailable in simPaleoTrees. By default, there is no
#' conditioning on the number of extant taxa, living taxa are sampled perfectly
#' at time 0 and zero-length branches are dropped. Unlike simFossilTaxa, you
#' cannot condition on a certain number of extant taxa, only whether they are
#' allowed or not (via all.extinct). As of version 1.6, there are now options
#' relating to speciation modes. By default, taxa are only simulated under
#' budding cladogenesis but this can be changed with the arguments anag.rate,
#' prop.bifurc and prop.cryptic. Trees with cryptic taxa are always returned
#' with cryptic taxa unmerged (see sampleRanges).
#' 
#' Because the divergence times are known perfectly, yet tips are at the
#' apparent time of extinction and unsampled taxa are dropped, one should not
#' use the output of this analysis except for very specialized simulation
#' analyses. The results are probably not anything like real datasets of
#' paleontological phylogenies, at least in most aspects.
#' 
#' The print.runs argument does not work precisely as in simFossilTaxa; it only
#' counts how many accepted datasets from simFossilTaxa are acceptable for
#' output after the simulation of sampling.

#' @inheritParams simFossilTaxa
#' @inheritParams simFossilTaxa_SRCond

#' @param ntrees Number of trees to simulate

#' @param all.extinct Condition on all taxa being extinct by modern? Default is
#' false

#' @param modern.samp.prob Probability of sampling living taxa at the present
#' day (time=0), see documentation for sampleRanges

#' @param prop.cryptic Proportion of branching events with no morphological
#' differentiation (i.e. cryptic speciation) relative to branching events
#' associated with morphological differentiation (budding and/or bifurcating 
#' cladogenesis). Trees with cryptic taxa are always returned with cryptic 
#' taxa unmerged (see sampleRanges).

#' @param drop.zlb Should zero-length branches be dropped?

#' @param ranges.only If TRUE (the default), the ranges returned in $ranges
#' are given as taxon first and last occurrences only. If
#' FALSE, $ranges returns the times of all sampling events for each taxon
#' as vectors within a list.

#' @param plot Should data be plotted as it is simulated?

#' @return Output is an object of class multiphylo containing the simulated
#' phylogenies, unless ntrees is one in which case the output is a phylogeny of
#' class 'phylo'.
#' 
#' Additionally, each of these simulated phylogenies will have the original
#' simulated taxa data (from simFossilTaxa) and sampled ranges (from
#' sampleRanges) attached as the elements $taxa and $ranges to each phylo
#' object.
