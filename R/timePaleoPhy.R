#' Timescaling of Paleo-Phylogenies
#' 
#' Timescales an unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa using information on their
#' temporal ranges, using various methods. Also can resolve polytomies randomly
#' and output samples of randomly-resolved trees.
#' 
#' @details These functions are an attempt to unify and collect previously used and
#' discussed methods for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa.
#' Unfortunately, it is occasional difficult to attribute some time-scaling methods to
#' specific references in the literature.
#' 
#' There are five method types that can be used by timePaleoPhy. Four of these
#' use some value of absolute time, chosen a priori, to time-scale the tree.
#' This is handled by the argument vartime, which is NULL by default and unused
#' for type "basic".
#' 
#' \describe{

#'  \item{"basic"}{This most simple of methods ignores vartime and
#' scales nodes so they are as old as the first appearance of their oldest
#' descendant (Smith, 1994). This method produces many zero-length branches
#' (Hunt and Carrano, 2010).}

#'  \item{"equal"}{The 'equal' method defined by G. Lloyd and used in Brusatte
#' et al. (2008) and Lloyd et al. (2012). Originally usable in code supplied by
#' G. Lloyd, it is recreated here. This method works by increasing the time of
#' the root divergence by some amount (here set by vartime) and then adjusting
#' zero-length branches so that time on early branches is re-apportioned out
#' along those later branches equally.}

#' \item{"aba"}{All branches additive. This method takes the "basic" tree and
#' adds vartime to all branches.}

#' \item{"zlba"}{Zero-length branches additive. This method adds vartime to all
#' zero-length branches in the "basic" tree. Discussed (possibly?) by Hunt and Carrano,
#' 2010.} 

#' \item{"mbl"}{Minimum branch length. Scales all branches so they are
#' greater than or equal to vartime, and subtract time added to later branches
#' from earlier branches in order to maintain the temporal structure of events.
#' A version of this was first introduced by Laurin (2004).} }
#' 
#' These functions cannot time-scale branches relative to reconstructed
#' character changes along branches, as used by Lloyd et al. (2012).
#' 
#' These functions will intuitively drop taxa from the tree with NA for range
#' or are missing from timeData or timeList. Taxa dropped from the tree will be
#' will be listed in a 
#' 
#' As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
#' decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.
#' 
#' timePaleoPhy is designed for direct application to datasets where taxon first 
#' and last appearances are precisely known in continuous time, with no stratigraphic
#' uncertainty. This is an uncommon form of data to have from the fossil record, 
#' although not an impossible form (micropaleontologists often have very precise 
#' range charts, for example). This means that most users SHOULD NOT use timePaleoPhy directly, 
#' unless they have written their own code to deal with stratigraphic uncertainty. For
#' some groups, the more typical 'first' and 'last' dates represent the minimum
#' and maximum absolute ages for the fossil collections that a taxon is known
#' is known from. Presumably, the first and last appearances of that taxon in
#' the fossil record is at unknown dates within these bounds. These should not
#' be mistaken as the FADs and LADs desired by timePaleoPhy, as timePaleoPhy 
#' will use the earliest dates provided to calibrate node ages, which is either
#' an overly conservative approach to time-scaling or fairly nonsensical.
#'
#' Alternatively to using timePaleoPhy, bin_timePaleoPhy is a wrapper of 
#' timePaleoPhy which produces timescaled trees for datasets which only have 
#' interval data available. For each output tree, taxon first and last appearance 
#' dates are placed within their listed intervals under a uniform distribution. 
#' Thus, a large sample of time-scaled trees will approximate the uncertainty in 
#' the actual timing of the FADs and LADs. 
#'
#' The input timeList object can have overlapping (i.e. non-sequential) intervals,
#' and intervals of uneven size. Taxa alive in the modern should be listed as last 
#' occurring in a time interval that begins at time 0 and ends at time 0. If taxa 
#' occur only in single collections (i.e. their first and last appearance in the 
#' fossil record is synchronous, the argument point.occur will force all taxa
#' to have instantaneous durations in the fossil record. Otherwise, by default,
#' taxa are assumed to first and last appear in the fossil record at different points
#' in time, with some positive duration. The sites matrix can be used to force
#' only a portion of taxa to have simultaneous first and last appearances.
#' 
#' By setting the argument nonstoch.bin to TRUE for bin_timePaleoPhy, the dates are NOT
#' stochastically pulled from uniform bins but instead FADs are assigned to the
#' earliest time of whichever interval they were placed in and LADs are placed
#' at the most recent time in their placed interval. This option may be useful
#' for plotting. The sites argument becomes arbitrary if nonstoch.bin is TRUE.
#' 
#' If timeData or the elements of timeList are actually data.frames (as output
#' by read.csv or read.table), these will be coerced to a matrix.

#' an example using real (graptolite) data, can be found here:

#' 
#' @aliases timePaleoPhy bin_timePaleoPhy

#' @param tree An unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa, of class 'phylo'. Tip labels
#' must match the taxon labels in the respective temporal data.

#' @param timeData Two-column matrix of first and last occurrences in absolute
#' continous time, with row names as the taxon IDs used on the tree. This means the
#' first column is very precise FADs (first appearance dates) and the second 
#' column is very precise LADs (last appearance dates), reflect the precise points
#' in time when taxa first and last appear. If there is stratigraphic uncertainty in
#' when taxa appear in the fossil record, please use the 'bin' time-scaling functions. 

#' @param type Type of time-scaling method used. Can be "basic", "equal",
#' "aba", "zbla" or "mbl". Type="basic" by default. See the note below for more
#' details

#' @param vartime Time variable; usage depends on the method 'type' argument.
#' Ignored if type = "basic"

#' @param ntrees Number of time-scaled trees to output. If ntrees is greater
#' than one and both randres and rand.obs are false, the function will fail and
#' a warning is issued, as these arguments would simply produce multiple
#' identical time-scaled trees.

#' @param randres Should polytomies be randomly resolved? By default,
#' timePaleoPhy does not resolve polytomies, instead outputting a time-scaled
#' tree that is only as resolved as the input tree. If randres=T, then
#' polytomies will be randomly resolved using \code{\link{multi2di}} from the
#' package ape. If randres=T and ntrees=1, a warning is printed that users
#' should analyze multiple randomly-resolved trees, rather than a single such
#' tree, although a tree is still output.

#' @param timeres Should polytomies be resolved relative to the order of
#' appearance of lineages? By default, timePaleoPhy does not resolve
#' polytomies, instead outputting a time-scaled tree that is only as resolved
#' as the input tree. If timeres=T, then polytomies will be resolved with
#' respect to time using the paleotree function \code{\link{timeLadderTree}}.
#' See that functions help page for more information; the result of time-order
#' resolving of polytomies generally does not differ across multiple uses,
#' unlike use of multi2di.

#' @param add.term If true, adds terminal ranges.By default, this function will
#' not add the ranges of taxa when time-scaling a tree, so that the tips
#' correspond temporally to the first appearance datums of the given taxa. If
#' add.term=T, then the 'terminal ranges' of the taxa are added to the tips
#' after tree is time-scaled, such that the tips now correspond to the last
#' appearance datums.

#' @param inc.term.adj If true, includes terminal ranges in branch length
#' estimates for the various adjustment of branch lengths under all methods
#' except 'basic' (i.e. a terminal length branch will not be treated as zero
#' length is this argument is TRUE if the taxon at this tip has a non-zero
#' duration). By default, this argument is FALSE and this function will not
#' include the ranges of taxa when adjusting branch lengths, so that
#' zero-length branches before first appearance times will be extended. An
#' error is returned if this argument is true but type="basic" or
#' add.term=FALSE, as this argument is inconsistent with those argument
#' options.

#' @param rand.obs Should the tips represent observation times uniform
#' distributed within taxon ranges? This only impacts the location of tip-dates, 
#' i.e. the 'times of observation' for taxa, and does not impact the dates used to 
#' determine node ages. Thus, this is an alternative to using only the LADs or only the FADs
#' as the per-taxon times of observation. For these functions,rand.obs is TRUE can only impact
#' the result when add.term is FALSE (otherwise the time of observation can only be the FADs) 
#' and so the function fails and a warning is issued. If rand.obs is TRUE, then it is assumed
#' that users wish the tips to represent observations made with some temporal
#' uncertainty, such that they might have come from any point within a taxon's
#' known range.  This might be the case, for example, if a user is interested in
#' applying phylogeny-based approaches to studying trait evolution, but have
#' per-taxon measurements of traits that come from museum specimens with
#' uncertain temporal placement. When rand.obs is TRUE, the tips are placed randomly
#' within taxon ranges, as if uniformly distributed, and thus multiple trees should be 
#' created and analyzed.

#' @param node.mins Minimum ages of nodes on the tree. The minimum dates of
#' nodes can be set using node.mins; this argument takes a vector of the same
#' length as the number of nodes, with dates given in the same order as nodes
#' are they are numbered in the tree$edge matrix (note that in tree$edge, the
#' tips are given first Ntip numbers and these are ignored here). Not all nodes
#' need be set; those without minimum dates can be given as NA in node.mins.

#' @param noisyDrop If TRUE (the default), any taxa dropped from tree due to not
#' having a matching entry in the time data will be listed in a system message.

#' @param plot If true, plots the input and output phylogenies.

#' @param timeList A list composed of two matrices giving interval times and
#' taxon appearance dates. The rownames of the second matrix should be the taxon IDs,
#' identical to the tip.labels for tree. See details.

#' @param nonstoch.bin If true, dates are not stochastically pulled from
#' uniform distributions. See below for more details.

#' @param sites Optional two column matrix, composed of site IDs for taxon FADs
#' and LADs. The sites argument allows users to constrain the placement of
#' dates by restricting multiple fossil taxa whose FADs or LADs are from the
#' same very temporally restricted sites (such as fossil-rich Lagerstatten) to
#' always have the same date, across many iterations of time-scaled trees. To
#' do this, simply give a matrix where the "site" of each FAD and LAD for every
#' taxon is listed, as corresponding to the second matrix in timeList. If no
#' sites matrix is given (the default), then it is assumed all fossil come from
#' different "sites" and there is no shared temporal structure among the
#' events.

#' @param point.occur If true, will automatically produce a 'sites' matrix
#' which forces all FADs and LADs to equal each other. This should be used when
#' all taxa are only known from single 'point occurrences', i.e. each is only
#' recovered from a single bed/horizon, such as a Lagerstatten.

#' @return The output of these functions is a time-scaled tree or set of
#' time-scaled trees, of either class phylo or multiphylo, depending on the
#' argument ntrees. All trees are output with an element $root.time. This is
#' the time of the root on the tree and is important for comparing patterns
#' across trees.
#' 
#' Trees created with bin_timePaleoPhy will output with some additional
#' elements, in particular $ranges.used, a matrix which records the
#' continuous-time ranges generated for time-scaling each tree. (Essentially a
#' pseudo-timeData matrix.)

#' @note Please account for stratigraphic uncertainty in your analysis.
#' Unless you have exceptionally resolved data, use a wrapper with timePaleoPhy,
#' either the provided bin_timePaleoPhy or code a wrapper function of your
#' own that accounts for stratigraphic uncertainty in your dataset. Remember that
#' the FADs (earliest dates) given to timePaleoPhy will *always* be used to 
#' calibrate node ages!
