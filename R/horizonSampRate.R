#' Estimate Sampling Rate from Sampling Horizon Data (Solow and Smith, 1997)
#'
#' This function implements the exact maximum likelihood estimator for the
#' instantaneous sampling rate from Solow and Smith (1997, Paleobiology),
#' which is based on the relationship between the number of collections for a
#' set of tax and their durations (known precisely in continuous time).

#' @details 
#' Given a dataset of taxa with a vector N, representing the number of
#' collections for each taxon, and a vector D, giving the precise duration
#' for each taxon, we can use the following maximum likelihood estimator from
#' Solow and Smith (1997) to obtain the instantaneous sampling rate:
#'
#' \eqn{samplingRate = (sum(N-1)^2)/(sum(D)*sum(N))}
#'
#' This method is exclusively for datasets with very precisely dated horizons,
#' such as microfossils from deep sea cores with very precise age models. The
#' first and last appearance must be known very precisely to provide an equally
#' precise estimate of the duration. Most datasets are not precise enough
#' for this method, due to chronostratigraphic uncertainty. However, note that the age
#' of individual collections other than the first and last appearance dates
#' do not need to be known: its only the number of collections that matters.

#' @param sampOcc A list with the number of elements equal to the number of taxa,
#' and each element of the list being a numerical vector with the length equal
#' to the number of collections for each taxon, and each value equal to the
#' precise date of that fossil's time of collection. These dates do not need
#' to be ordered. If not supplied, the elements durations and nCollections must
#' be supplied.

#' @param durations A vector of precise durations in continuous time, with the
#' length equal to the number of taxa. If not suppliedthis is calculated from
#' SampOcc, which must be supplied.

#' @param nCollections A vector of integers representing the number of
#' collections for each taxon in the input durations. If not supplied
#' this is calculated from SampOcc, which must be supplied.

#' @return
#' Returns the instantaneous sampling (in lineage*time-units) as a
#' single numerical value. Note that this is the instantaneous sampling
#' rate and not the probability of sampling a taxon per interval.

#' @seealso
#' Duration frequency methods (Foote and Raup, 1996; Foote, 1997) use
#' ranges alone to estimate sampling parameters, implemented in
#' \code{\link{durationFreq}}.

#' \code{\link{SamplingConv}}.

#' @examples
#' #can simulate this type of data with sampleRanges
#'     # just set ranges.only = FALSE
#' #let's try a simulation example:
#' set.seed(444)
#' record<-simFossilRecord(p=0.1, q=0.1, nruns=1,
#'	nTotalTaxa=c(30,40), nExtant=0)
#' taxa<-fossilRecord2fossilTaxa(record)
#' sampledOccurrences <- sampleRanges(taxa,r = 0.5,ranges.only = FALSE)
#' 
#' # now try with horizonSampRate
#' horizonSampRate(sampOcc = sampledOccurrences)
#' 
#' # but we could also try with the *other* inputs
#'    # useful because some datasets we may only have durations
#'    # and number of sampling events for
#' filtered <- sampledOccurrences[!is.na(sampledOccurrences)] 
#' dur <- sapply(filtered,max) - sapply(filtered,min)
#' nCol <- sapply(filtered,length)
#' # supply as durations and nCollections
#' horizonSampRate(durations = dur, nCollections=nCol)
