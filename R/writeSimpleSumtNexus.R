# write simple sumt

# The standard MrBayes output format for summary trees is difficult to read into and depict in R with support values at nodes. 
# This script creates a NEXUS file with a MrBayes block that would load the output of existing MrBayes analyses, 
# then run the 'sumt' command with the correct formatting for use in R, thus quickly generating all desired summary trees in the correct format.
