Version 1.6 - 11-05-12
-Changes to bin time-scaling functions so that rand.obs and FAD.only conditions were forwarded to their associated functions, rather than done  by the bin wrapper function (this caused problems with the calculation of the weight adjustment for the cal3 methods)
-New function fixRootTime which is called by any other function which needs to fix $root.time elements after dropping taxa, etc.
	-Uses solution for fixing root.times previous being used by dropZLB
-Inconsistency found in how root.time elements were fixed in terminal-branch dropping functions; dropExtant was found to be buggy
-New simulation functions for 'candle trees' which are clades were all observable taxa are monophyletic lineages which correspond to the terminal branches of a phylogeny
-Changes to taxa2phylo so that an error is returned if observation times outside the original taxon ranges are passed to it
-SRC method is now considered deprecated and is removed from the public release of paleotree, along with any references in the help files. The SRC method, as of 10/29/12, can be found in the paleotree github repo in the deprecated functions folder. THE AUTHOR OF THIS PACKAGE STRONGLY RECOMMENDS NOT TO USE THE SRC METHOD. Users interested in using rate calibrated timescaling should use cal3 instead.
-cal3 is now modified so that step.size can be changed as an argument
-cal3 is modified so that differences between time of observation and LAD do not cause differences in the extent to which nodes are dated, by adding the densities calculated for 'unconsidered' potential node ages to the maximum potential node agenot alter the placement of node ages, which can be modified with 
-Bug fixed whereby cal3 was unable to properly use the rand.obs argument, giving out trees with time of obs at the LADs instead (perhaps the package author may have been drunk or just feeling reckless when he wrote the rand.obs arguments in the various timescaling functions?)
-Bug fixed in simFossilTaxa where some sets of conditions would sometimes produce an error in some runs (thanks Tiego Quental for the bug report!)
-Bug fixed in using rand.obs argument in timePaleoPhy where timeData was recycled over many runs (thanks Roger Benson for the bug report!)
-Modified cal3 timescaling methods to have a randres option and to allow per-taxon anc.wt values
-Modified plotMultiDiv to allow plotting multiple diversity curves, by default as a crazy rainbow

version 1.5 - 10/05/12
-New functions, cal3TimePaleoPhy and bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy, similar to SRC methods but different probability equations used, req div rates
-Modifications to SRC methods to work more like how cal3 calculates unobs evol history at each node
-Added function freqRat for estimating the per-interval sampling probability via the frequency ratio method of Foote and Raup (1996)
-Added function rootSplit, which finds most basal split among a set of taxa
-Added function timeLadderTree, which resolves polytomies according to order of appearance
-Added function reverseList, which takes a hierarchial list and reverses that hierarchial order
-fixed bug in binTimeData where extant taxa were returned as NA in the output timeList object
-Modified function compareNodeAges to allow multiple trees as input, for all nodes shared in common among all input trees
-Modification to diversity curve functions so plots are cut off before going past the Modern (time 0)
-Modification to avgtaxa equation used in simFossilTaxa_SRcond. See help file for details.
-Warning/Error Line added to timePaleoPhy in case phylogeny tips are not a character vector like they should be

version 1.4 - 06/17/12
-Added a CITATION file, accessible via citation("paleotree")
-Added randLiveHat option to sampleRanges which controls how the 'hats' of taxa still alive at the modern day are treated
-modified how timeData and timeList input were handled in various functions so that data.frames were converted to matrices
-Added count.cryptic argument to simFossilTaxa and simFossilTaxa_SRCond
-Fixed error where simFossilTaxa_SRCond treated anag.rate as prop.bifurc (and vice versa)
-Cleaning up of help files: fixing typos, weird line breaks, clarification

version 1.3 - 04/17/12
-The various 'bin' time-scaling functions for phylogenies now include a non-stochastic option, for prettier plotting.
-Added new features to sampleRanges for variation in sampling rate similar to Liow et al. 2010
-New feature added to binTimeData to allow for pre-made intervals to be used
-Changed the naming of output from diversity curve functions, simFossilTaxa and sampling rate estimating functions
-Added split.int and timelims arguments to diversity curve functions to stop 'spiky' diversity curve syndrome
-Changed all 'T's and 'F's to TRUE and FALSE statements in code
-Changes made to simFossilTaxa for cryptic cladogenesis, requiring change in output and several other functions
-Changes made to simFossilTaxa for pure-birth simulations
-Changes made to simFossilTaxa_SRcond to fix simulations to right number of nExtant with bifurcation/anagenesis
-The sampling rate/probability estimation functions now print warning messages if convergence does not occur
-Added some additional warning messages to functions
-New function for simulating speciational/cladogenetic patterns of trait evolution under a Brownian model
-New functions for analyzing differences in time-scaling between two phylo objects
-General cleanup of typos and clarification in manual files

version 1.2 - 02/22/12
-changes made to "bin_" time-scaling functions to improve computational speed
-changes made to some help files to add clarification, some examples added

version 1.1 - 02/13/12
-changes made to conditioning structure in simFossilTaxa
	-changes also to simFossilTaxa_SRCond and simPaleoTrees as a result of this
-additional clarification of help files
-changed all calls of print() in the functions to message()

version 1.0 - 01/27/12
