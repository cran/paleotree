\usage{
getSampRateCont(timeData, n_tbins = 1, grp1 = NA, grp2 = NA,
  threshold = 0.1, est_only = FALSE, iterations = 1e+06, initial = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
  \item{timeData}{Two-column matrix of per-taxon first and
  last occurrence given in continuous time, relative to the
  modern (i.e. older dates are also the 'larger' dates).}

  \item{n_tbins}{Number of time bins with different
  sampling/extinction parameters}

  \item{grp1}{A vector of integers or characters, the same
  length as the number of taxa in timeData, where each
  taxon-wise element gives the group ID of the taxon for
  the respective row of timeData}

  \item{grp2}{A vector of integers or characters, the same
  length as the number of taxa in timeData, where each
  taxon-wise element gives the group ID of the taxon for
  the respective row of timeData}

  \item{threshold}{The smallest allowable duration (i.e.
  the measured difference in the first and last occurrence
  dates for a given taxon). Durations below this size will
  be treated as "one-hit" sampling events.}

  \item{est_only}{If true, function will give back a matrix
  of ML extinction rates and sampling probabilities per
  species rather than usual output (see below)}

  \item{iterations}{Maximum number of iterations the
  optimizer is run for}

  \item{initial}{Values used as initial parameter value to
  initiate the optimizing function. The same starting value
  is used for all parameters}
}
\value{
If est_only = T, a matrix of per-taxon sampling and
extinction parameters is output.

If est_only = F (default), then the output is a list:

\item{Title}{Gives details of the analysis, such as the
number and type of parameters included and the number of
taxa analyzed} \item{parameters}{Maximum-likelihood
parameters of the sampling model} \item{log.likelihood}{The
maximum support (log-likelihood) value} \item{AICc}{The
second-order Akaike's Information Criterion, corrected for
small sample sizes} \item{convergence}{A number indicating
status of convergence; if 0 then convergence was reached;
see help file for optim for the respective error list}
\item{message}{Messages output by optim(); check to make
sure that model convergence occurred}

If multi-class models are fit, the element $parameters will
not be present, instead there will be several different
elements that describe the characteristic parameter
'components' for each class, rather than representing the
parameters of actual taxa in that class. As noted in the
$title, these should not be interpreted as the actual
rates/probabilities associated with any real taxa but
rather as factors which must be multiplied in combination
with the estimates for other classes to be meaningful. For
example, for taxa of a given group in a given time bin,
their extinction rate is the extinction rate component of
that time bin times the extinction rate component of their
group. Completeness estimates will be output with these
parameters as long as classes are not overlapping, as those
estimates would not otherwise refer to meaningful groups of
taxa.

\description{
Uses maximum likelihood to estimate instantaneous sampling
and extinction rates, given a set of continuous-time taxon
ranges from the fossil record
}
\details{
As of version 1.9 of paleotree, this function is retained
for historical purposes and users should instead apply the
functions listed at \code{\link{durationFreq}}. The new
functions do not offer as many options as this function,
but are much simpler and (in a sense) offer very different
options for constraining parameter space.

This function uses maximum-likelihood solutions obtained by
Foote (1997). These analyses are ideally applied to data
from single stratigraphic section but potentially are
applicable to regional or global datasets, although the
behavior of those datasets is less well understood.

getSampRateCont allows for a considerable level of
versatility in terms of the variation allowed among taxa in
model parameters (extinction rate and sampling
probability/rate). Essentially, taxa are divided into
different (possibly overlapping) classes which have
'average' parameter values. These average parameters are
multiplicatively-combined to calculate per-taxon
parameters. For example, perhaps a user hypotheses that
taxa which live in a particular environment have different
characteristic sampling rates, that taxa of several
different major clades have different characteristic
sampling rates and that there may be several temporal
shifts in the characteristic extinction rate. The
classification IDs for the first two can be included as
per-taxon vectors (of either character or integers) as the
arguments 'grp1' and 'grp2' and the hypothesized number of
temporal breaks included as the n_tbins argument. A model
where taxa differ in parameters across time, clades and
environments will thus be fit and the AIC calculated, such
that this model's fit can be compared to other (probably
simpler) models.

By default, a simple model is fit to the range data where
all taxa belong to a single class, with a single
characteristic extinction rate and a single characteristic
sampling rate.

The timebins option allows for time intervals with
different characteristic model parameters which are not
defined a priori. The boundaries between time intervals
with different characteristic parameters will thus be
additional free-floating parameters included in the AIC
calculation. If you have the prior inclination that
sampling/extinction changed at a specific point in time,
then seperate the taxa that originated before and after
that point as two different groups and include those
classifications as a group in the arguments.

This function does not implement the finite window of
observation modification for dealing with range data
containing extant taxa and thus that continues up to the
recent (Foote, 1997). This is planned for a future update,
however. For now, data input into this function should be
for taxa that have already gone extinct by the modern and
are not presently extant.

As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute
time is always decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.

Please check the $message and $convergence elements of the
output to make sure that convergence occurred. The
likelihood surface can be very flat in some cases,
particularly for small datasets (<100 taxa). If convergence
was not reached, a warning message is communicated. If the
optimizer does not converge, consider increasing iterations
or changing the starting values.

As the limited time-window option of Foote (1997) is not
implemented, any taxa listed as being at time 0 (and thus
being extant) are dropped before the model fitting it
performed.

#the most simple model (the first value) has the lowest AICc (most informative!)
