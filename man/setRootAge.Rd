\title{Place a Non-Ultrametric Tree of Fossil Taxa on Absolute Time}
\usage{
setRootAge(tree, fixedAges = NULL)

setRootAges(trees, fixedAges = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogeny with branch lengths of type "phylo".}

\item{fixedAges}{A table of fixed ages for tip taxa, generally as a dataframe where the
first column is of type character, and the second column is of type numeric. =Such a table is automatically
generated as an attribute of the output from \code{\link{obtainDatedPosteriorTreesMrB}}, 
when argument \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE}.}

\item{trees}{A list of type "multiPhylo" consisting of multiple phylogenetic trees with branch lengths.}
}
\value{
The input tree is output, with a new \code{$root.time} element.
}
\description{
This function uses a table of fixed dates for operational-taxon-units (tip taxa) to calculate the absolute
age of the root divergence for a tree with branch lengths, and then appends this root age to the tree
as a \code{$root.time} element, and then outputs the tree. Function \code{setRootAges} is a wrapper for
\code{setRootAge} for use with multiple trees in a "multiPhylo" object.
}
\details{
Trees of fossil taxa come with one issue rarely encountered by those dealing with molecular
phylogenies: the absolute timing of when tips and divergences is not certain. With the vast
majority of molecular phylogenies, it can be assumed the youngest tips occur at 0 time -- i.e.,
the modern. This knowledge gives the tree an anchor for figuring out the absolute timing of events.
Many programs and other software designed for depicting and analyzing phylogenetic hypotheses
assumes such an apparent absolute time-scale (in R and elsewhere). A tree of Paleozoic brachiopods that include no
extant members has no such anchor at time=0, and such a default assumption in available
software can be misleading. The $root.time protocol is intended to grant this
absolute time-scale to a dated tree of fossil taxa, and is appended by most of the
dating functions in package paleotree. However, trees dated by other approaches, such as via tip-dating in
programs such as MrBayes and BEAST, will not have $root.time elements when read into R.
