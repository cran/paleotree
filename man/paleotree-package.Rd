\title{paleotree: Paleontological and Phylogenetic Analyses of Evolution}
\description{
Analyzes, time-scales and simulates phylogenies of extinct/fossil lineages. Also plots diversity curves for stratigraphic range data and phylogenies, including combinations of these two data types.

This package contains functions for analyzing sampling rates given ranges of fossil taxa, in both continuous and discrete time, functions for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa and functions for simulating the fossil record in both a taxic and phylogenetic varieties and converting between these.

\examples{
##Simulate some fossil ranges with simFossilTaxa()
set.seed(444)
taxa<-simFossilTaxa(p=0.1,q=0.1,nruns=1,mintaxa=20,maxtaxa=30,maxtime=1000,maxExtant=0)
#let's see what the 'true' diversity curve looks like in this case
#plot the FADs and LADs with taxicDivCont()
taxicDivCont(taxa)

#simulate a fossil record with imperfect sampling with sampleRanges()
rangesCont<-sampleRanges(taxa,r=0.5)
#plot the diversity curve based on the sampled ranges
layout(matrix(1:2,,2))
taxicDivCont(rangesCont)

#Now let's use binTimeData() to bin in intervals of 1 time unit
rangesDisc<-binTimeData(rangesCont,int.length=1)
#plot with taxicDivDisc()
taxicDivDisc(rangesDisc)
#compare to the continuous time diversity curve

#taxa2phylo assumes we know speciation events perfectly... what if we don't?
#first, let's use taxa2cladogram() to get the 'ideal' cladogram of the taxa
cladogram<-taxa2cladogram(taxa,plot=TRUE)
#Now let's try timePaleoPhy() using the continuous range data
ttree<-timePaleoPhy(cladogram,rangesCont,type="basic",plot=TRUE)
#plot diversity curve 
phyloDiv(ttree,drop.ZLB=TRUE)

#that tree lacked the terminal parts of ranges (tips stops at the taxon FADs)
#let's add those terminal ranges back on with add.term
ttree<-timePaleoPhy(cladogram,rangesCont,type="basic",add.term=TRUE,plot=TRUE)
#plot diversity curve 
phyloDiv(ttree)
