This package contains functions for analyzing sampling rates given ranges of fossil taxa, in both continuous and discrete time, functions for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa and functions for simulating the fossil record in both taxic and phylogenetic varieties.

##Simulate some fossil ranges with simFossilTaxa
set.seed(444);
taxa <- simFossilTaxa(p=0.1,q=0.1,nruns=1,mintaxa=20,maxtaxa=30,maxtime=1000,maxExtant=0)
#let's see what the 'true' diversity curve looks like in this case
#plot the FADs and LADs with taxicDivCont()
taxicDivCont(taxa)

#simulate a fossil record with imperfect sampling with sampleRanges
rangesCont <- sampleRanges(taxa,r=0.5)
#plot the diversity curve based on the sampled ranges
layout(1:2)
taxicDivCont(rangesCont)
#Now let's use binTimeData to bin in intervals of 10 time units
rangesDisc <- binTimeData(rangesCont,int.length=10)
#plot with taxicDivDisc
taxicDivDisc(rangesDisc)
#compare to the continuous time diversity curve

#taxa2phylo assumes we know speciation events perfectly... what if we don't?
#first, let's use taxa2cladogram to get the 'ideal' cladogram of the taxa
cladogram <- taxa2cladogram(taxa,plot=TRUE)
#Now let's try timePaleoPhy using the continuous range data
ttree <- timePaleoPhy(cladogram,rangesCont,type="basic",plot=TRUE)
#plot diversity curve
phyloDiv(ttree,drop.ZLB=TRUE)

#that tree lacked the terminal parts of ranges (tips stops at the taxon FADs)
#let's add those terminal ranges back on with add.term
ttree <- timePaleoPhy(cladogram,rangesCont,type="basic",add.term=TRUE,plot=TRUE)
#plot diversity curve 
phyloDiv(ttree)
