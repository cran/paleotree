}
\value{
This function gives back a list containing nruns number of taxa
datasets, where each element is a matrix. If nruns=1, the output is not a
list but just a single matrix. Sampling has not been simulated in the output
for either function; the output represents the 'true' history of the
simulated clade.

For each dataset, the output is a six column per-taxon matrix where all
entries are numbers, with the first column being the taxon ID, the second
being the ancestral taxon ID (the first taxon is NA for ancestor), the third
column is the first appearance date of a species in absolute time, the
fourth column is the last appearance data and the fifth column records
whether a species is still extant at the time the simulation terminated (a
value of 1 indicates a taxon is still alive, a value of 0 indicates the
taxon is extinct). The sixth column (named "looks.like") gives information
about the morphological distinguishability of taxa; if they match the taxon
ID, they are not cryptic. If they do not match, then this column identifies
which taxon id they would be identified as.

Each matrix of simulated data also has rownames, generally of the form "t1"
and "t2", where the number is the taxon id. Cryptic taxa are instead named
in the form of "t1.2" and "t5.3", where the first number is the taxon which
they are a cryptic descendant of (i.e. column 6 of the matrix,
"looks.like"). The second number, after the period, is the rank order of
taxa in that cryptic group of taxa. Taxa which are the common ancestor of a
cryptic lineage are also given a unique naming convention, of the form
"t1.1" and "t5.1", where the first number is the taxon id and the second
number communicates that this is the first species in a cryptic lineage.

As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.

\details{
simFossilTaxa simulates a birth-death process (Kendall, 1948; Nee, 2006),
but unlike most functions for this implemented in R, this function enmeshes
the simulation of speciation and extinction with explicit models of how
lineages are morphologically differentiated, as morphotaxa are the basic
units of paleontological estimates of diversity and phylogenetics.

Any particular use of simFossilTaxa will probably involve iteratively
running many simulations of diversification. Simulation runs are only
accepted for output if and when they meet the conditioning criteria defined
in the arguments, both minima and maxima. If min.cond is true (the default),
simulations will be stopped and accepted when clades satisfy mintime,
mintaxa, minExtant and maxExtant (if the later is set). To reduce the effect
of one conditioning criterion, simply set that limit to an arbitrarily low
or high number (depending if a minimum or maximum constraint is involved).
If min.cond is false, simulation runs are not stopped and evaluated for
output acceptance until they (a) go completely extinct or (b) hit either
maxtaxa or maxtime. Whether the simulation runs are accepted or not for
output is still dependent on mintaxa, mintime, minExtant and maxExtant. Note
that some combinations of conditions, such as attempting to condition on a
specific non-zero value of minExtant and maxExtant, may take a long time to
find any acceptable simulation runs.

This function continues the simulation once mintaxa or minExtant is
hit, until the next taxon (limit +1) originates. Once the simulation
terminates, it is judged whether it is acceptable for all conditions given
and if so, the run is accepted as a dataset for output.

Please note that mintaxa and maxtaxa refer to the number of static
morphotaxa birthed over the entire evolutionary history of the simulated
clade, not the extant richness at the end of the simulation. Use minExtant
and maxExtant if you want to condition on the number of taxa living at some
time.

The simFossilTaxa function can effectively simulate clades evolving under
any combination of the three "modes" of speciation generally referred to by
paleontologists: budding cladogenesis, branching cladogenesis and anagenesis
(Foote, 1996). The first two are "speciation" in the typical sense used by
biologists, with the major distinction between these two modes being whether
the ancestral taxon shifts morphologically at the time of speciation. The
third is where a morphotaxon changes into another morphotaxon with no
branching, hence the use of the terms "pseudoextinction" and
"pseudospeciation". As bifurcation and budding are both branching events,
both are controlled by the p, the instantaneous rate, while the probability
of a branching event being either is set by u. By default, only budding
cladogenesis occurs To have these three modes occur in equal proportions,
set p to be twice the value of w and set u to 0.5.

This function also includes the ability to simulate cryptic cladogenesis.
The available patterns of morphological speciation thus form a gradient:
cryptic cladogenesis has no morphological shifts in either daughter branches
after a branching event, budding cladogenesis has one morphological shift in
the two daughter lineages and, in bifurcating cladogenesis, shifts occur in
both daughter lineages. The argument prop.cryptic dictates what proportion
of branching/cladogenesis events (the overall occurance of which with rate
p) are cryptic versus those that have some morphological divergence (either
budding of bifurcating. prop.bifurc controls the proportion of
morphologically divergent cladogenesis which is bifurcating relative to
budding. Thus, for example, the probability of a given cladogenesis event
being budding is (1-prop.cryptic)*prop.bifurc.

When there is cryptic speciation, by default, the conditioning arguments
involving numbers of taxa (mintaxa, maxtaxa, minExtant and maxExtant) count
the number of unique morphologically distinguishable taxa is checked (i.e.
the number of unique values in column 6 of the simulated data). This
behavior can be changed with the argument count.cryptic.See below about the
output data structure to see how information about cryptic cladogenesis is
recorded. The functions taxa2phylo, taxa2cladogram and taxicDivCont each
handle cryptic species in different ways, as described in their respective
help files.

If maxExtant is 0, then the function will be limited to only accepting
simulations that end in total clade extinction before maxtime.

If conditions are such that a clade survives to maxtime, then maxtime will
become the time of first appearance for the first taxa. Unless maxtime is
very low, however, it is more likely the maxtaxa limit will be reached
first, in which case the point in time at which maxtaxa is reached will
become the present data and the entire length of the simulation will be the
time of the first appearance of the first taxon.

simFossilTaxa simulates single taxa until they go extinct or exceed maxtime.
This means the function may have fully simulated some lineages for thousands
of time-steps while others are not yet simulated, and thus sometimes
overshoot constraints on the number of taxa. This function will
automatically discard any runs where the number of taxa exceeds 2 x maxtaxa
to avoid blowing up computation time. This is likely to happen under a
pure-birth scenario; I suggest using low maxtime settings if doing a
pure-birth simulation.

simFossilTaxa_SRCond is a wrapper for simFossilTaxa for when clades of a
particular size are desired, post-sampling. For more details, see the help
file at \code{\link{simFossilTaxa_SRCond}}.
