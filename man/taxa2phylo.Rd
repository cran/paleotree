\title{Convert Simulated Taxon Data into a Phylogeny}
\usage{
taxa2phylo(taxad, obs_time = NULL, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxad}{A five-column matrix of taxonomic data, as output by
simFossilTaxa}

\item{obs_time}{A vector of per-taxon times of observation which must be in
the same order of taxa as in the object taxad; if NULL, the LADs (column 4)
in taxad2 are used}

\item{plot}{Plot the resulting phylogeny?}
}
\value{
The resulting phylogeny with branch lengths is output as an object
of class phylo. This function will output trees with the element $root.time,
which is the time of the root divergence in absolute time.

The tip labels are the rownames from the simulation input; see simFossiltaxa
documentation for details.
}
\description{
Converts temporal and ancestor-descendant relationships of taxa into a
time-scaled phylogeny
}
\details{
As described in the documentation for taxa2cladogram, the relationships
among morphotaxa in the fossil record are difficult to describe in terms of
traditional phylogenies. One possibility is to arbitrarily choose particular
instantaneous points of time in the range of some taxa and describe the
time-scaled relationships of the populations present at those dates. This is
the tactic used by taxa2phylo.

By default, the dates selected ('obs-time' argument) are the last occurances
of the taxon, so a simple use of this function will produce a time-scaled
tree which describes the relaitonships of the populations present at the
last occurance of each taxon in the sampled data. Alternatively, obs_time
can be supplied with different dates within the taxon ranges.

All data relating to when static morpho-taxa appear or disappear in the
record is lost; branching points will be the actual time of speciation,
which (under budding) will often be in the middle of the temporal range of a
taxon.

Cryptic taxa are not dropped or merged as can be done with taxa2cladogram.
The purpose of taxa2phylo is to obtain the 'true' pattern of evolution for
the observation times, independent of what we might actually be able to
recover, for the purpose of comparing in simulation analyses.

As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.
}
\note{
DO NOT use this function to time-scale a real tree for a real dataset.
It assumes you know the divergence/speciation times of the branching nodes
and relationships perfectly, which is almost impossible given the
undersampled nature of the fossil record. Use timePaleoPhy or
cal3TimePaleoPhy instead.

DO use this function when doing simulations and you want to make a tree of
the 'true' history, such as for simulating trait evolution along
phylogenetic branches.

Unlike taxa2cladogram, this function does not merge cryptic taxa in output
from simFossilTaxa and I do not offer an option to secondarily drop them.
The tip labels should provide the necessary information for users to drop
such taxa, however. See simFossilTaxa.
