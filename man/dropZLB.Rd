\title{Drop Terminal Zero-Length Branches}
\description{
Drops all terminal branches and tip nodes of a tree that is zero-length. Useful for paleo-trees, as ancestral taxa will often come out as these "ZLBS".
}
\usage{dropZLB(tree)}
\arguments{
  \item{tree}{A phylogeny as a phylo object}
}
\details{
This function drops tip-taxa that are attached to the tree as zero-length branches ("ZLBs"). This is advised for analyses of diversification/diversity, as these will appear as instanteous speciation+extinction events, when in reality they probably represent 'pseudo-speciation' (also referred to as anagenesis).

Note this function only drops terminal tips that are on a ZLB. If you want to drop internal zero-length branches, see \code{\link{di2multi}}

If the tree given to the function as a $root.time element, as expected for most paleo-tree objects handled by this library, that root.time is adjusted if the relative time of the root divergence changes when ZLBs are dropped.
}
\value{
Gives back a modified phylogeny as a phylo object
