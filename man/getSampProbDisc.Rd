\title{Fit Models of Sampling Probability to Discrete-Interval Taxon Ranges}
\usage{
getSampProbDisc(timeData, n_tbins = 1, grp1 = NA, grp2 = NA,
  est_only = FALSE, iterations = 10000, initial = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeData}{A 2 column matrix with the first and last occurrences of taxa
given in relative time intervals (i.e. ordered from first to last). If a list
of length two is given for timeData, such as would be expected if the output
of binTimeData was directly input, the second element is used.}

\item{n_tbins}{Number of time bins with different sampling/extinction
parameters}

\item{grp1}{A vector of integers or characters, the same length as the
number of taxa in timeData, where each taxon-wise element gives the group ID
of the taxon for the respective row of timeData}

\item{grp2}{A vector of integers or characters, the same length as the
number of taxa in timeData, where each taxon-wise element gives the group ID
of the taxon for the respective row of timeData}

\item{est_only}{If true, function will give back a matrix of ML extinction
rates and sampling probabilities per species rather than usual output (see
below)}

\item{iterations}{Maximum number of iterations the optimizer is run for}

\item{initial}{Values used as initial parameter value to initiate the
optimizing function. The same starting value is used for all parameters}
}
\value{
If est_only = TRUE, a matrix of per-taxon sampling and extinction
parameters is output.

If est_only = FALSE (default), then the output is a list:

\item{Title}{Gives details of the analysis, such as the number and type of
parameters included and the number of taxa analyzed}
\item{parameters}{Maximum-likelihood parameters of the sampling model}
\item{log.likelihood}{The maximum support (log-likelihood) value}
\item{AICc}{The second-order Akaike's Information Criterion, corrected for
small sample sizes} \item{convergence}{A number indicating status of
convergence; if 0 then convergence was reached; see help file for optim for
the respective error list} \item{message}{Messages output by optim; check to
make sure that model convergence occurred}

If multi-class models are fit, the element $parameters will not be present,
instead there will be several different elements that describe the
characteristic parameter 'components' for each class, rather than
representing the parameters of actual taxa in that class. As noted in the
$Title, these should not be interpreted as the actual rates/probabilities
associated with any real taxa but rather as factors which must be multiplied
in combination with the estimates for other classes to be meaningful. For
example, for taxa of a given group in a given time bin, their extinction
rate is the extinction rate component of that time bin times the extinction
rate component of their group. Completeness estimates will be output with
these parameters as long as classes are not overlapping, as those estimates
would not otherwise refer to meaningful groups of taxa.

As the limited time-window option of Foote (1997) is not implemented, any
taxa listed as being in a bin with start time 0 and end time 0 (and thus
being extant without question) are dropped before the model fitting it
performed.

\description{
Uses maximum likelihood to estimate per-interval sampling probability and
extinction rate, given a set of discrete-interval taxon ranges from the
fossil record. This function can fit models where there are different
groupings of taxa with different parameters and different free-floating time
intervals with different parameters.
}
\details{
As of version 1.9 of paleotree, this function is retained for historical
purposes and users should instead apply the functions listed at
\code{\link{durationFreq}}. The new functions do not offer as many options
as this function, but are much simpler and (in a sense) offer very different
options for constraining parameter space.

This function uses maximum-likelihood solutions obtained by Foote (1997).
These analyses are ideally applied to data from single stratigraphic section
but potentially are applicable to regional or global datasets, although the
behavior of those datasets is less well understood.

getSampProbDisc allows for a considerable level of versatility in terms of
the variation allowed among taxa in model parameters (extinction rate and
sampling probability/rate). Essentially, taxa are divided into different
(possibly overlapping) classes which have 'average' parameter values. These
average parameters are multiplicatively-combined to calculate per-taxon
parameters. For example, perhaps a user hypotheses that taxa which live in a
particular environment have different characteristic sampling probabilities,
that taxa of several different major clades have different characteristic
sampling probabilities and that there may be several temporal shifts in the
characteristic extinction rate. The classification IDs for the first two can
be included as per-taxon vectors (of either character or integers) as the
arguments 'grp1' and 'grp2' and the hypothesized number of temporal breaks
included as the n_tbins argument. A model where taxa differ in parameters
across time, clades and environments will thus be fit and the AIC
calculated, such that this model's fit can be compared to other (probably
simpler) models.

By default, a simple model is fit to the range data where all taxa belong to
a single class, with a single characteristic extinction rate and a single
characteristic sampling probability.

The timebins option allows for time intervals with different characteristic
model parameters which are not defined a priori. The boundaries between time
intervals with different characteristic parameters will thus be additional
free-floating parameters included in the AIC calculation. If you have the
prior inclination that sampling/extinction changed at a specific point in
time, then seperate the taxa that originated before and after that point as
two different groups and include those classifications as a group in the
arguments.

This function does not implement the finite window of observation
modification for dealing with range data containing extant taxa and thus
that continues up to the recent (Foote, 1997). This is planned for a future
update, however. For now, data input into this function should be for taxa
that have already gone extinct by the modern and are not presently extant.

The intervals in timeData should be non-overlapping sequential intervals of
roughly equal length. These should be in relative time, so the earliest
interval should be 1 and it should increase as the intervals go up with age.
This is so differences in interval numbers represents the same rough
difference in interval timing. For example, a dataset where all taxa are
listed from a set of sequential intervals of similar length, such as North
American Mammal assemblage zones, microfossil faunal zones or graptolite
biozones can be given as long as they are correctly numbered in sequential
order in the input. As a counter example, a dataset which includes taxa
resolved only to intervals as wide as the whole Jurassic and taxa resolved
to biozones within the Jurassic should not be included in the same input.
Drop the taxa from less poorly resolved intervals from such datasets if you
want to apply this function, as long as this retains a large enough sample
of taxa from the sequential intervals. Note that taxicDivDisc and the "bin_"
timescaling methods do not require that intervals be truly sequential (they
can be overlapping; see their helpfiles). The output from binTimeData is
always sequential, at least by default.

Please check the $message and $convergence elements of the output to make
sure that convergence occurred. The likelihood surface can be very flat in
some cases, particularly for small datasets (<100 taxa). If convergence was
not reached, a warning message is communicated. If the optimizer does not
converge, consider increasing iterations or changing the starting values.
