\title{R-Mode vs Q-Mode Two-Way Cluster Analyses and Abundance Plot for Community Ecology Data}
\usage{
twoWayEcologyCluster(xDist, yDist, propAbund, clustMethod = "average",
  marginBetween = 0.1, abundExpansion = 4, xAxisLabel = "Across Sites",
  yAxisLabel = "Across Taxa")
}
\arguments{
\item{xDist}{The pair-wise distance matrix for the cluster diagram drawn along the
horizontal axis of the graphic. Should be a distance matrix, or a matrix that can
be coerced to a distance matrix, for the same number of units as rows in \code{propAbund}.}

\item{yDist}{The pair-wise distance matrix for the cluster diagram drawn along the
vertical axis of the graphic. Should be a distance matrix, or a matrix that can
be coerced to a distance matrix, for the same number of units as columns in \code{propAbund}.}

\item{propAbund}{A matrix of abundance data, preferably relative
abundance scaled as proportions of the total number of individuals
at each site. This data determines the size scale of the taxon/site dots.}

\item{clustMethod}{The agglomerative clustering method used, as with
argument \code{method} with function \code{hclust}. \code{clustMethod} must
be one of \code{"average"} (the default method for this function, also known as
average-linkage or as UPGMA), \code{"ward.D"}, \code{"ward.D2"}, \code{"single"}, \code{"complete"},
\code{"mcquitty"} (also known as WPGMA), \code{"median"}
(also known as WPGMC) or \code{"centroid"} (also known as UPGMC).}

\item{marginBetween}{Argument controlling space placed between
the cluster diagrams and the abundance plot. Default is 0.1.}

\item{abundExpansion}{An argument that is a multiplier controlling the size
of dots plotted for reflecting relative abundance.}

\item{xAxisLabel}{The label placed on the horizontal axis of the plot.}

\item{yAxisLabel}{The label placed on the vertical axis of the plot.}
}
\value{
This function creates a plot, and returns nothing, not even invisible output.
}
\description{
This mode plots both R-mode (across sites) and Q-mode (across taxa) dendrograms
for a community ecology dataset, with branches aligned with a grid of dots
representing the relative abundance of taxa at each site in the dataset.
}
\details{
You might be able to apply this to datasets that aren't community ecology datasets
of proportional abundance, but I can't guarantee pr even predict what will happen.
