\title{Scale Tree to Unit-Length}
\usage{
unitLengthTree(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{an object of class phylo}
}
\value{
Returns the modified phylogeny as an object of class phylo. Any
$root.time element is removed.
}
\description{
Rescales all edges of a phylogeny to be equal to 1 ("unit-length").
}
\details{
Probably not a good way to scale a tree for comparative studies.
What does it mean to scale every edge of the phylogeny to the same length?
}
\examples{
set.seed(444)
tree <- rtree(10)
layout(1:2)
plot(tree)
plot(unitLengthTree(tree))
layout(1)
}
\seealso{
As an alternative to using unitLengthTree in comparative studies,
see \code{\link{timePaleoPhy}}

See also \code{speciationalTree} in the package geiger, which does
essentially the same thing as unitLengthTree.
