differentiation (i.e. cryptic speciation) relative to branching events
associated with morphological differentiation (budding and/or bifurcating
cladogenesis).}

\item{count.cryptic}{If TRUE, cryptic taxa are counted as separate taxa for
conditioning limits, such as maxtaxa or maxExtant. If FALSE, then each cryptic

output to the terminal.}

\item{plot}{If TRUE, plots the diversity curves of accepted simulations.}
}
\value{
This function gives back a list containing nruns number of taxa
datasets, where each element is a matrix. If nruns=1, the output is not a
list but just a single matrix. Sampling has not been simulated in the output
for either function; the output represents the 'true' history of the
simualted clade.

For each dataset, the output is a six column per-taxon matrix where all
entries are numbers, with the first column being the taxon ID, the second
being the ancestral taxon ID (the first taxon is NA for ancestor), the third
column is the first appearance date of a species in absolute time, the
fourth column is the last appearance data and the fifth column records
whether a species is still extant at the time the simulation terminated (a
value of 1 indicates a taxon is still alive, a value of 0 indicates the
taxon is extinct). The sixth column (named "looks.like") gives information
about the morphological distinguishability of taxa; if they match the taxon
ID, they are not cryptic. If they do not match, then this column identifies
which taxon id they would be identified as.

Each matrix of simulated data also has rown ames, generally of the form "t1"
and "t2", where the number is the taxon id. Cryptic taxa are instead named
in the form of "t1.2" and "t5.3", where the first number is the taxon which
they are a cryptic descendant of (i.e. column 6 of the matrix,
"looks.like"). The second number, after the period, is the rank order of
taxa in that cryptic group of taxa. Taxa which are the common ancestor of a
cryptic lineage are also given a unique naming convention, of the form
"t1.1" and "t5.1", where the first number is the taxon id and the second
number communicates that this is the first species in a cryptic lineage.

As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.

\description{
Function for simulating taxon ranges and relationships under various models
of evolution, conditioned on creating clades large enough to sample some
average number of taxa at a given sampling rate.

\details{
This function is effectively a wrapper for \code{\link{simFossilTaxa}}
so please the help file for that function in addition.

simFossilTaxa_SRCond is a wrapper for simFossilTaxa for when clades of a
particular size are desired, post-sampling. simFossilTaxa simulates a
birth-death process (Kendall, 1948; Nee, 2006), but unlike most functions
for this implemented in R, this function enmeshes the simulation of
speciation and extinction with explicit models of how lineages are
morphologically differentiated, as morphotaxa are the basic units of
paleontological estimates of diversity and phylogenetics. For more details
on the workings of simFossilTaxa and many of the arguments involved, please
see the help file for simFossilTaxa (\code{\link{simFossilTaxa}}).
simFossilTaxa_SRCond first calculates the expected proportion of taxa
sampled, given the sampling rate and the rates which control lineage
termination: extinction, anagenesis and bifurcation. The average original
clade size needed to produce, on average, a given number of sampled taxa
(the argument 'avgtaxa') is calculated with the following equation:

\eqn{N = avgtaxa / (r / (r + (q + anag.rate + (prop.bifurc * p)) ))}

We will call that quantity N. Note that the quantity (prop.bifurc * p)
describes the rate of bifurcation when there is no cryptic cladogenesis, as
prop.bifurc is the ratio of budding to bifurcating cladogenesis. This
equation will diverge in ways that are not easily predicted as the rate of
cryptic speciation increases. Note, as of version 1.5, this equation was
altered to the form above. The previous form was similar and at values of
avgtaxa greater than 10 or so, produces almost identical values. The above
is preferred for its relationship to taxonomic completeness (Solow and
Smith, 1997).

Next, this value is used with simFossilTaxa, where mintaxa is set to N and
maxtaxa set to 2*N. simFossilTaxa_SRcond will generally produce simulated
datasets that are generally of that size or larger post-sampling (although
there can be some variance). Some combinations of parameters may take an
extremely long time to find large enough datasets. Some combinations may
produce very strange datasets that may have weird structure that is only a
result of the conditioning (for example, the only clades that have many taxa
when net diversification is low or negative will have lots of very early
divergences, which could impact analyses). Needless to say, conditioning can
be very difficult.

set.seed(444)

avgtaxa <- 50
r <- 0.5

#using the SRcond version
taxa <- simFossilTaxa_SRCond(r=r,p=0.1,q=0.1,nruns=20,avgtaxa=avgtaxa)
#now let's use sampleRanges and count number of sampled taxa
ranges <- lapply(taxa,sampleRanges,r=r)
ntaxa <- sapply(ranges,function(x) sum(!is.na(x[,1])))
hist(ntaxa)
mean(ntaxa)
#works okay... some parameter combinations are difficult to get right number of taxa
