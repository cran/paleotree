\title{Taking a Timeslice of a Tree}
\description{Removes the portion of a tree after a set point in time, as if the tree had been sliced at that moment.}
\usage{timeSliceTree(ttree, sliceTime, drop.extinct = F, plot = T)}
\arguments{
  \item{ttree}{A time-scaled phylogeny of class phylo}
  \item{sliceTime}{Time to 'slice' the tree at. See details below.}
  \item{drop.extinct}{If true, drops tips that go extinct before timeSlice.}
  \item{plot}{If true, plots input and output trees for comparison.}
}
\details{
The sliceTime is always calculated as on the same as scale as ttree$root.time, which the time before present that the root divergence occurred. In other words, if root.time=100, then timeSlice=80 will slice the tree 20 time units after the root.

The function assumes that ttree will generally have an element called $root.time. If $root.time is not present as an element of ttree, then it is assumed the tip furthest from the root is at time 0 (present-day) and a new $root.time is calculated (a warning will be issued in this case).

If drop.extinct=T, then extinct tips are dropped and (if present) the $root.time of ttree is adjusted.

\value{
Returns the modified phylogeny as an object of class phylo
