\usage{
dropZLB(tree)

dropExtinct(tree, tol = 0.01, ignore.root.time = FALSE)

dropExtant(tree, tol = 0.01)

addTermBranchLength(tree, addtime = 0.001)

fixRootTime(treeOrig, treeNew, consistentDepth = TRUE,
  nodeAgeTransfer = TRUE)

dropPaleoTip(tree, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogeny as a phylo object. dropPaleoTip requires this
input object to also have a $root.time element.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for determining modern age; used for distinguishing
extinct from extant taxa. Tips which end within 'tol' of the furthest
distance from the root will be treated as 'extant' taxa for the purpose of
keeping or dropping.}

\item{ignore.root.time}{Ignore root.time in calculating which tips are
extinct? root.time will still be adjusted}

\item{addtime}{Extra amount of time to add to all terminal branch lengths.}

\item{treeOrig}{A phylo object of a time-scaled phylogeny with a $root.time
element}

\item{treeNew}{A phylo object containing a modified form of treeOrig (with
no extra tip taxa added, but possibly with some tip taxa removed).}

\item{consistentDepth}{A logical, either TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE (the default)
the tree's root-to-furthest-tip depth is tested to make sure this depth is
not greater than the new root.time appended to the output tree.}

\item{nodeAgeTransfer}{A logical. If TRUE, the root.time of the new tree is determined by
comparing the clades of taxa between the two input trees. The new root age assigned is the age of
(\emph{1}) the treeOrig clade that contains *all* taxa present in treeNew and, if the set of (1)
contains multiple clades, (\emph{2}) the clade in the (1) set that contains the fewest taxa not in
treeNew. If FALSE, the root.time assigned to treeNew is the root.time of treeOrig, adjusted
based on the change in total tree depth between treeOrig and treeNew, as measured between the root and
the first matching taxon in both trees. The later is how fixRootTime functioned by default
prior to paleotree v2.3.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to dropPaleoTip are passed to drop.tip}
}
\value{
Gives back a modified phylogeny as a phylo object, generally with a
modified $root.time element.

\description{
These functions modify terminal branches or drop certain terminal branches
based on various criteria.
}
\details{
DropZLB drops tip-taxa that are attached to the tree via zero-length
terminal branches ("ZLBs"). This is sometimes useful for paleo-trees, as
various time-scaling methods often produce these ZLBs, taxa whose early
appearance causes them to be functionally interpreted as ancestors in some
time-scaling methods. Removing ZLBs is advised for analyses of
diversification/diversity, as these will appear as simultaneous
speciation/extinction events. Note this function only drops tips attached to
a terminal zero-length branch; if you want to collapse internal zero-length
branches, see the ape function \code{\link{di2multi}}.

DropExtinct drops all terminal branches which end before the modern (i.e.
extinct taxa). DropExtant drops all terminal branches which end at the
modern (i.e. extant/still-living taxa). In both cases, the modern is defined
based on tree$root.time if available, or the modern is inferred to be the
point in time when the tip furthest from the root (the latest tip)
terminates.

If the input tree has a $root.time element, as expected for most paleo-tree
objects handled by this library, that root.time is adjusted if the relative
time of the root divergence changes when terminal branches are dropped.
Adjusted root.times are only given if the input tree has root.times.

addTermBranchLength adds an amount equal to the argument 'addtime' to the
terminal branch lengths of the tree. If there is a $root.time element, this
is increased by an amount equal to addtime. A negative amount can be input
to reduce the length of terminal branches. However, if negative branch
lengths are produced, the function fails and a warning is produced. This function
does *not* call fixRootTime, so the root.time elements in the result tree may
be nonsensical, particularly if negative amounts are input.

When a tree is modified, such as having tips dropped or branches extended,
fixRootTime can be used to find the new $root.time. It is mainly used as a
utility function called by a majority of the other functions discussed
in this help file.

dropPaleoTip is a wrapper for ape's \code{drop.tip} which also modifies the
$root.time element if necessary, using fixRootTime.
